## 🧾 Python Project: Quality Control Metrics – *Wireless Earbuds Manufacturing*

import numpy as np

# ----------------------------
# 📦 Production Data Setup
# ----------------------------
# 10 batches, 100 units per batch

units_per_batch = 100
batches = 10
total_units = units_per_batch * batches

# Manual fake data - inspection results for each batch (1 = Pass, 0 = Defect)
inspection_results = np.array([
    [1]*98 + [0]*2,
    [1]*97 + [0]*3,
    [1]*96 + [0]*4,
    [1]*98 + [0]*2,
    [1]*99 + [0]*1,
    [1]*96 + [0]*4,
    [1]*97 + [0]*3,
    [1]*95 + [0]*5,
    [1]*98 + [0]*2,
    [1]*97 + [0]*3
])

# Rework and Scrap items per batch 
rework_counts = np.array([1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2])
scrap_counts = np.array([1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1])

# Customer complaints and return data
customer_complaints = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1])
returns = np.array([1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1])

# Failures during use (for MTBF)
failures = np.array([5, 4, 6, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5, 3, 4])
operational_days = 180

# ----------------------------
# 📊 Quality Metrics Calculation
# ----------------------------

# ✅ 1. Defect Rate
defect_rate = 1 - np.sum(inspection_results) / total_units

# ✅ 2. First Pass Yield (FPY)
fpy = np.mean(np.sum(inspection_results, axis=1) / units_per_batch)

# ✅ 3. Rework Rate
rework_rate = np.sum(rework_counts) / total_units

# ✅ 4. Scrap Rate
scrap_rate = np.sum(scrap_counts) / total_units

# ✅ 5. Customer Complaint Rate
complaint_rate = np.sum(customer_complaints) / total_units

# ✅ 6. Return Rate
return_rate = np.sum(returns) / total_units

# ✅ 7. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
mean_mtbf = operational_days / np.mean(failures)

# ✅ 8. Process Capability (Dummy Cp, Cpk Example)
# Assume spec limits: Lower = 95, Upper = 105, Mean = 100, std = 3
USL, LSL = 105, 95
process_std = 3
process_mean = 100
cp = (USL - LSL) / (6 * process_std)
cpk = min((USL - process_mean), (process_mean - LSL)) / (3 * process_std)

# ✅ 9. Inspection Coverage
inspection_coverage = 1.0  # 100% inspection

## 📘 Business Insights & Learnings

| 🔍 Metric                   | 💼 Insight                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Defect Rate**             | Very low defect rate (\~2-3%) → Great production quality.   |
| **FPY**                     | Over 96% units pass without rework → Efficient process.     |
| **Rework Rate**             | Small rework needed; can still aim to reduce.               |
| **Scrap Rate**              | Minimal waste — good for profitability and sustainability.  |
| **Complaint & Return Rate** | Below 2% — strong customer satisfaction.                    |
| **MTBF**                    | High reliability (\~40+ days before failure on average).    |
| **Cp, Cpk**                 | Values >1.33 mean process is well within control limits.    |
| **Inspection Coverage**     | 100% inspection builds trust and ensures consistent output. |



## 🧠 Why It Matters in Real Business

* **Product Reliability**: MTBF helps predict warranty issues and design better products.
* **Customer Trust**: Low returns & complaints signal brand quality.
* **Cost Savings**: Low scrap/rework reduces hidden losses.
* **Decision-Making**: High Cp/Cpk means the process doesn’t need urgent improvement, saving investment.
